# Clipboard

**Clipboard** is a Minecraft mod that introduces a clipboard manager in Minecraft! You can also choose whether to prioritize the System clipboard or the Custom clipboard, choose whether to save the clipboard or not, or to enable/disable it altogether. To open the Clipboard screen, press (B) by default, and click on the Settings button to configure it.

## **How it works**
**If Clipboard is enabled and Custom Clipboard is prioritized**:
- **Ctrl + C**: Copies to both the System clipboard and the Custom clipboard.
- **Ctrl + V**: Pastes from the Custom clipboard.

**If Clipboard is enabled but Custom Clipboard is not prioritized**:
- **Ctrl + C**: Copies to both the System clipboard and the Custom clipboard.
- **Ctrl + V**: Pastes from the System clipboard.

**If Clipboard is disabled**:
- The Custom clipboard will remain untouched and inactive, but you can still view its contents.

**Managing Clipboard Items**:
- **Delete an item**: Press the delete button or use **Shift + Left Click**.
- **Copy an item**: Left Click the item or click the Copy button to move it to the top of the list, and copy to your System and Custom Clipboard.
